You can adjust the position by checking "Edit table position" at the top left of the figure,  
And dragging the table.

### Add Relation

In the ERD generated by default, there is no relation information between tables.  
To add a relation to the ERD, You need to create relation information and load it.  
There are several ways to give a relation information.

```
 $ cd <Rails.root.dir>
 $ schemard gen-relation > db/relation.metadata
```

```
 $ schemard -i <path/to/schema.rb> -f db/relation.metadata
